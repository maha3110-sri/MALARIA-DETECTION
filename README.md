# Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using
machine learning techniques based on behavioral and demographic data.
Early prediction can help in faster screening and awareness.

## Project Description
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental condition that affects
communication, behavior, and social interaction. This project uses
machine learning classification algorithms to predict the likelihood
of autism traits from given input features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is large and cannot be uploaded
directly to GitHub due to file size limitations.
